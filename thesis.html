        <h1>Master's Thesis: Incentivizing Scientific Research Using a Reputation-Scaled Proof of Stake Blockchain</h1>
        <p>A novel blockchain system designed to combat misinformation and echo chambers by incentivizing rational discourse and scientific reasoning.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="project-overview">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The rise of misinformation and echo chambers in social media platforms has led to biased discourse and a lack of critical thinking in discussions. This thesis proposes a blockchain-based system to encourage rational decision-making and promote access to accurate information.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="project-overview">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The thesis proposes a "Reputation Scaled - Proof of Stake" consensus mechanism, where a user's reputation (built through consistent, rational voting) scales their staking power. This new blockchain aims to combat echo chambers on social media by rewarding users for engaging in discussions and supporting viewpoints with scientific or logical backing. The work examines decentralized ledgers, blockchain properties, and existing consensus mechanisms, suggesting modifications to incentivize critical thinking. The proposed system incorporates delegates, voters, and experts, each incentivized to promote rational debate and sound reasoning. Smart contracts and tokens facilitate secure transactions, staking, and issue resolution. Ethical considerations and potential improvements, such as a core belief database and gamification, are also discussed to ensure fairness and inclusivity.</p>

        <h2>Goals of the System</h2>
        <p>The primary objective of this blockchain system is to create an <b>environment that promotes and incentivizes critical thinking and debate.</b> This goal is divided into the following sub-goals:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Provide fair incentives</b> for discussions to encourage meaningful engagement.</li>
            <li><b>Encourage users to invest in their opinions,</b> making them more deliberate in decision-making.</li>
            <li><b>Promote scientific reasoning</b> by rewarding users for backing their opinions with logical or empirical evidence.</li>
            <li><b>Ensure anonymity while maintaining accountability,</b> allowing free expression without fear while ensuring responsible participation.</li>
            <li><b>Develop an alternative consensus mechanism</b> that does not rely solely on <b>buying power or computing resources,</b> allowing users to <b>scale up influence through reputation and rational engagement.</b></li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section class="reputation-formula">
        <h2>Reputation-Scaled Proof of Stake Formula</h2>
        <p>The system utilizes a <b>Reputation-Scaled Proof of Stake (RS-PoS)</b> model, where a userâ€™s effective stake is determined by:</p>
    
        <div class="formula-box">
            <p><b>Effective Stake = Staked Cryptocurrency Ã— Reputation Score</b></p>
        </div>
    
        <p>This formula ensures that users who have a <b>history of rational voting and participation</b> are given <b>greater influence</b>, rather than relying solely on financial means. It allows dedicated and rational participants to <b>compete with high-stake holders</b> on an equal footing, fostering a fairer, more democratic decision-making process.</p>

            <button class="faq-question">ðŸ”¹ What problem does this thesis aim to solve?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The thesis addresses the increasing prevalence of <b>echo chambers</b> and <b>misinformation</b>, particularly within online social media. It proposes a blockchain-based system to incentivize <b>critical reasoning</b> and rational discourse, improving access to accurate information.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">ðŸ”¹ What is Reputation-Scaled Proof of Stake, and how does it work?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Reputation-Scaled Proof of Stake (RS-PoS) is a modified PoS consensus mechanism where a user's stake, and therefore their influence, is <b>scaled by their reputation</b>. Reputation is earned by <b>voting for the winning stance</b> on issues or demonstrating a strong commitment to their beliefs, ensuring that rational thinkers gain more influence over time.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">ðŸ”¹ How are users incentivized to participate in the system?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The system offers incentives based on user roles:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Delegates:</b> Stake cryptocurrency on issues and gain rewards if their stance aligns with the final consensus.</li>
                    <li><b>Voters:</b> Earn weight and rewards for choosing the winning stance.</li>
                    <li><b>Experts:</b> Selected council members receive a fixed payment for scientific and logical contributions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">ðŸ”¹ What are the different "transaction types" in this blockchain?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The system defines several custom transactions:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>STAKE:</b> Lock cryptocurrency to compete for validation.</li>
                    <li><b>BUYINFIRST:</b> Initiate a new issue or proposal with a minimum stake.</li>
                    <li><b>VOTE:</b> Record voter stances on an issue.</li>
                    <li><b>EXPERT-VOTE:</b> Experts vote with weighted influence.</li>
                    <li><b>FINAL-VOTE:</b> The last round of voting determines final consensus.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">ðŸ”¹ What is the role of the Expert Council in the system?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Experts act as a check and balance, similar to a judiciary. Their opinions carry significant weight and are based on scientific or logical backing rather than political influence.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">ðŸ”¹ What security measures does this blockchain use?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Security is ensured through properties such as <b>Common Prefix</b>, <b>Chain Quality</b>, and <b>Chain Growth</b>. Additionally, blocks include <b>posHash</b> and <b>accHash</b> fields to verify consensus and account model states.
